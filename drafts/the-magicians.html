  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Hello, friends,</p>
<p>I'm sitting down to write the second installment of ReadYa, and it's
been over a year since the first arrived in your Inbox. You may not
even remember signing up to receive it. At the time I billed it as a
&quot;bi-weekly newsletter on young adult literature, old and new.&quot; Let's
just call it &quot;periodic&quot; rather than &quot;bi-weekly&quot;. So what is it that
prompted me to dust off the QWERTY and write to you again, after so
much time? Magicians. <a class="reference internal" href="#id1">The Magicians</a>, that is.</p>
<p>It's been a while since a book made me feel the way XXX YYY's The
Magicians did. Liar and Spy did it. Jo Walton's Among Others. But it's
rarified company. The feeling that I'd rather sit and read <em>this book</em>
than do almost anything else. I knew I had to write to you about The
Magicians just a few days after starting it. I arrived at the office
early, which is usually my favorite time to be at work: it's quiet and
still, and I can ease into my day without distraction. I sat down at
my desk, leaned back in my chair, and looked up and out the skylight,
and I felt incredibly sad that it would be hours before I picked up
The Magicians again.</p>
<p>I'd heard The Magicians described as a blend of Narnia and Hogwarts
before picking it up, but that shorthand does a disservice to everyone
involved. Yes, there is a magical world called Fillory. And yes, there
is a school of magic, Brakebills. But the comparisons end there. The
Magicians takes place not in a world of noble deeds and divine
justice: it takes place in a world where people are mean to one
another, they're insecure and afraid, and they get bored. It takes
place in a world where you believe that the only way to survive is to
escape. It's a world that felt incredibly real and accurate to me, a
world that I can inhabit at times.</p>
<p>Quentin, our protaganist, is smart. Very, very smart. And bored.
Brookyln is his home, but it feels like a cage. And any color pales in
comparison to Fillory, a world described in a series of young adult
books which Quentin thinks he <em>should</em> have outgrown a long time ago.
I imagine that when Quentin is sitting in class, taking an exam in a
blue book, he looks out the window and imagines Fillory outside of it,
and his chest fills with grief that it is not really there, that
instead he is writing long hand in Number 2 pencil.</p>
<p>When Quentin is invited to matriculate at a school of magic, wonderous
things happen. And after a whlie he realizes that feeling doens't go
away, there's always something more to want.</p>
<p>The Magicians evoked a breadth of feelings in me as I read. I felt
excitement and suspense as Quentin navigates the halls of Brakebills
and learns magic. I felt sadness and empathy and he tries to figure
out what it is he wants, and continues to come up short. (How many
times have I known what I wanted, but felt unable to or unworthy of
articulating it?) And I felt sadness when things didn't turn out for
characters the ways I hoped.</p>
<p>I am almost afraid to read the sequel to The Magicians, The XXX Magic
Magic; I fell so completely in love with The Magicians that I'm not
sure what could follow it. But I think everyone should read The
Magicians, especially anyone who ever felt like their adolescence was
something to be sloughed off when their life &quot;really&quot; began.</p>
<p>XOXO</p>
