Some books seem to hang out on your shelf --- physical or otherwise --- until the moment you really need them. That moment when you're open to the story and willingly sink into it, happy to inhabit another world for a chunk of time. _**[Landline](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18081809-landline)**_, by [Rainbow Rowell](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4208569.Rainbow_Rowell), did just that until last week when I finally picked it up. I read _[Eleanor and Park](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15745753-eleanor-park)_, _[Fangirl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16068905-fangirl)_, and _[Carry On](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28356624-carry-on)_ over the years, and enjoyed them all. (They'd each make a really great Read Ya! post.) _Landline_ was described to me as "Rainbow Rowell's novel for adult adults instead of young adults", but don't let that scare you away: it invoked the same sort of emotional resonance as her other work has for me.

_Landline_ covers what might be familiar emotional territory for Rowell's readers: the way relationships evolve, unfold, and surprise us; the uncertainty of growing older; and expectations met and unmet. She also explores a question we've **all** asked ourselves from time to time:

> If I had a magic phone that let me talk to the past,
> what would I say?

Georgie McCool is a television writer who has a shot at her dream: a series of her own, created with her long-standing friend and writing partner, Seth. Of course it's not that easy: they need to deliver scripts immediately after Christmas, which means Georgie is going to miss Christmas with her in-laws in Nebraska. Unlike _Eleanor & Park_, _Landline_ doesn't shift perspectives between the parties in the relationship. We stick with Georgie in all of her uncertainty, self doubt, and fear. The use of a single perspective throughout worked for me: we still see all the mis-steps and misinterpretations that people in relationships make, but we get to discover them along _with_ the narrator.

Rowell's books are a joy for me to read because she's so good at crafting characters that seem to have too many words in their lives, both in their conversation and in their own heads. The banter between characters makes them seem as real to me as any act or other detail. My favorite TV shows almost all have excellent banter, so I squeed a little when Rowell name-checked [Amy Sherman-Palladino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Sherman-Palladino).

> “[W]e will write ourselves a script. We’ll go Amy Sherman-Palladino on its ass.”
> “I love Amy Sherman-Palladino.”
> “I know,” he said, crunching his eyebrows at her meaningfully. “I’m your best friend.”

I think another reason _Landline_ resonated for me is because it explores questions that feel so familiar to me: what if you don't know _what_ you want? how do you know it's what you want, and not what you're "supposed" to want? how do you know it's what you want, and not what's "easy"? I'm nearly 40 years old and these are questions I still ask with painful frequency. _Landline_ is YA literature for my 30-something inner young adult.
